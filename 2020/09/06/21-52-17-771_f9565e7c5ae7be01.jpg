            <title>Talking, teaching and timetabling science</title>
            <link>http://my.rsc.org/blogs/85/1881</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
Have your say about science provision: are schools offering students equal learning opportunities?

Join the Royal Society of Chemistry, Royal Society of Biology, Royal Society, Institute of Physics and ASE for this year’s Talking Science debate to discover the factors influencing schools’ decisions about science provision.

These learned bodies share the desire to ensure that all students have equal opportunities to continue studying in the sciences up to the age of 16 and beyond, and their recent research aimed to identify common timetabling models and the extent of their use, processes used to allocate students and teachers, and the extent to which schools are using potentially problematic timetabling models. Anecdotal evidence suggests that timetabling and other curriculum-related constraints are influencing schools’ decisions about different routes through the sciences at 14–16. These constraints impact on, for example, the distribution of science teaching between specialist and non-specialist teachers in school, with consequences for student experience and outcomes.

Chairing the discussion is the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Education in Chemistry board member, David Read, with panellists including the Royal Society of Biology’s head of education policy, Lauren MacLeod and the Inspiration Trust’s subject specialist leader for chemistry, Lucy Austin.

Be a part of the discussion potentially shaping schools’ decision making about science timetabling, and ultimately students’ choice about their science education. This debate could inform decision making not only in schools, but at policymaker level too. Join in to provide your students with the best opportunities to fulfil their scientific potential.

            <title>How your feedback is shaping our developments</title>
            <link>http://my.rsc.org/blogs/85/1853</link>
            <description><![CDATA[In late 2017, we commissioned some research to find out more about what science teachers and technicians across the UK and Ireland thought of the help they get from the Royal Society of Chemistry.  We also wanted to know what they want from us in the future.  If you were one of the 500 who responded, then thank you.  Your insights have helped to tell us what teachers’ and technicians’ main concerns are and what we can do to help.From the support we already provide, many of you told us that you find Learn Chemistry and Education in Chemistry useful — especially to support practical work.  We’ve been working hard recently to make sure both of these provide information that’s easy to apply in the classroom. Lots of you spoke about wanting it to be easier to find resources that are linked to the new specifications, particularly due to the recent curriculum reforms in the UK and Ireland.  We’re now working hard to find ways to address this.Those of you who had been to our local events found them useful.  However, many people who replied didn’t know about them.   Due to this feedback, we’ve recently changed the look and layout of your regional newsletter.  We hope that this makes it easier for you to find out about and register for local events.We also found other areas where we can improve.  You told us you want more clarity about the exact purpose and benefits of Learn Chemistry Partnership (LCP), and what you should do once you’ve joined.  We’re busy planning how we can ensure that LCP provides benefits and support that will really help you to inspire your students in chemistry.   We’re also planning to introduce online features for LCP that will make it easier to find our support.  We want to continue to get your input into these ideas, so in May this year we asked you to help test some of our early plans for these new online features.  We had an enthusiastic response to our request for help, so thank you if you were one of the people who volunteered.  You gave us some great insights about how to make things clear and easy to use. It’s still early days for these developments, and we’ll be asking for more of your feedback as we go along.  If you’re interested in helping us test the new service, please get in touch.<br /><br />Posted by Emily Howe<br />Jun 22, 2018 4:54 pm<hr noshade />]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[We’re making improvements to our schools network, Learn Chemistry Partnership (LCP).  To make sure we create a service that provides support which is truly meaningful, we’re looking for feedback on new ideas for creating an improved web experience for our partner schools.
If you’re a teacher, technician, or work in a school, we’d love to hear from you.  To take part, we’d need to speak to you for about an hour at a time convenient to you between now and the end of May.  There’s no need to travel — you’d just need access to a computer with an internet connection, a speaker and a microphone. 
By taking part, we’ll ask you to try out some of the new online features we’ve got planned, giving you the opportunity to experience and give feedback on exciting new developments for LCP.  This is a great chance to help us shape the service we deliver to you.
As a thank you for your time, you’d receive a £20 Amazon gift voucher. 
If you’d like to take part, please get in touch. <br /><br />Posted by Emily Howe<br />Apr 23, 2018 12:59 pm<hr noshade />]]></description>

            <title>Classic practicals get a health and safety update</title>
            <link>http://my.rsc.org/blogs/85/1842</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Over the past few months, we’ve been checking the health and safety guidance in some of our most popular demonstrations and class practicals is up to date, and we’ve now published those changes.
The procedures in our Classic chemistry experiments, Classic chemistry demonstrations and Chemistry for non-specialists books are known and loved by many chemistry teachers, and many have been freely available on Learn Chemistry since 2012. We’ve collaborated with SSERC (Scottish schools education research centre) to check these procedures and guidance notes, and have made improvements to match the latest best practice and policy. We’ve now published updated versions of these practicals on Learn Chemistry. Use them with the confidence that you are accessing the most up-to-date versions of these classic procedures.
We’ve removed some supporting videos, and three experiments outright, because it wasn’t possible to update them sufficiently in their current form. For example, the Screaming jelly baby has taken a temporary holiday from Learn Chemistry. However, we will publish alternatives or updates to these in the coming months.
Our health and safety work is on-going. We recently updated our popular Nuffield practical chemistry collection, and we’ll be checking more of our practicals over the coming months. This year, we’re reviewing and editing 200 practical resources. If you want to know more about our work to maintain over 2,000 teaching and learning resources, email learn-chemistry@rsc.org.

            <title>Learn Chemistry’s design refresh</title>
            <link>http://my.rsc.org/blogs/85/1836</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Over the last few months we’ve been doing some development work on Learn Chemistry and some of our other educational sites. This has ranged from small fixes to new features like the more prominent download box for editable resources.

 

The latest changes include a refresh of the site’s look and feel, as well as some changes around how to use the site. The visual refresh isn’t solely cosmetic, although part of the aim is to make the site feel less dated. Based on feedback and user testing, it includes some simplification and de-cluttering that make the site easier to use.
 

New home page layout
 

The search bar is now more prominent. It’s the main way the site is used, and we want to make sure it’s easy to find.


We’ve removed a number of items on the page that weren’t used much and/or confused users: The “Teachers, Students, Higher Education, News” panels, the social sharing buttons (Twitter, Google Plus etc), and the resource counter.


We’ve removed the Browse Resources control. Testing and feedback suggested that most users thought this was a search filter, and it wasn’t used much. Removing it focuses the page on the search box and highlighted resources.


We’ve simplified the design visually. Cleaner lines, more spacing, and less on the page make the page quicker to navigate, and the highlighted resources more prominent.
 

New site navigation
 

Learn Chemistry used to have multiple navigation menus. These were confusing and took up valuable space, making the site hard to navigate on mobile devices. We’ve replaced these with a new navigation menu at the top of the site, which is designed to be more mobile friendly.

 

The new top navigation bar retains most of the elements of the existing one, and replaces the links to other RSC sites. This also removes the other search box which searched across all RSC sites, and caused some confusion.

 

Simpler look and feel across the site
 

The new visual design on the home page removes the coloured background and makes the menus smaller. This has also been rolled out across the rest of the site, and most of the sub-sites.

 

We hope you like the new design, and look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.
